In this short tutorial, you'll see serverless computing in action. You'll go through the following steps: 

1. Check out a brief discussion of the scenario and a few words about Knative
1. Use a YAML file to deploy a service to Knative running in OpenShift
1. View the OpenShift console to look at the service you just deployed
1. Run a React-based web application to use the service 
1. Amuse yourself for a few seconds so that Knative kills (_aka_ scales to zero) the service
1. Go back to the web application and see that Knative restarts the application to handle the demand. 

Let's get started!
